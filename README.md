# AKDF-LQSI-Source: Automated keratitis diagnosis framework for low-quality slit-lamp images
# create time: 2025.2.6

# Introduction
This repository contains the source code for the Automated Keratitis Diagnosis Framework for Low-Quality Slit-Lamp images (AKDF-LQSI). 
This method effectively improves the accuracy of automatic keratitis diagnosis on low-quality slit-lamp images by leveraging the SCUNet and GCT-DenseNet121 models.

# Prerequisites
* Ubuntu: 18.04 lts
* Python 3.7.8
* Pytorch 1.6.0
* NVIDIA GPU + CUDA_10.1 CuDNN_7.5

This repository has been tested on four NVIDIA TITAN. Configurations (e.g batch size, image patch size) may need to be changed on different platforms.

# Installation
Other packages are as follows:
* pytorch: 1.6.0 
* wheel: 0.34.2
* yaml:  0.2.5
* numpy: 1.19.1
* opencv-python: 4.6.0.66
* tourchvision: 0.7.0
* wheel:  0.34.2
* timn: 0.4.12
* scikit-image: 0.19.2
* scikit-learn: 0.23.2
* matplotlib: 3.3.1
* efficientnet-pytorch: 0.7.1
* ipython: 7.30.1
* pandas: 1.2.3
* protobuf: 3.13.0
* h5py: 3.5.0
* albumentations: 1.3.1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
* The file "create_lowquality_data.py" in /AKDF-LQSI-Source is used to generate GLQS(generated low-quality slit-lamp) images.
* The file "train_scunet.py" in /AKDF-LQSI-Source is used for the SCUNet model training.Farmework
* The file "test.py" in /AKDF-LQSI-Source is used for the SCUNet model testing.
* The file "SGCT_DenseNet_train_or_test.py" in /AKDF-LQSI-Source contains is used for the GCT-DenseNet121 model training and testing.



The expected output: print the classification probabilities for  keratitis, other cornea abnormalities (Other), and normal cornea (Normal).
